So far the progress is going slow but going well. I feel like we have a great framework to go off of, but with it being just the two of us it is going slower than expected. I still feel like we are going to be able to give a great finished product, but it isn't going to be there until the very end.

This is a screenshot of the basic work that we have done so far. We're planning on it spanning a few story lines with different people going through a theme park at night with some unfortunate surprises. Eventually, we're going to have some of the characters switch up to give it some more depth and to not make it as linear as it currently looks.

This part is an example of one of the storylines ending. This is supposed to be sort of a horror type game, or at least we are attempting to make it one. Will it actually be that scary at all? I guess only the people playing it will be able to tell us. I feel like any feedback we get will be very helpful as neither of us are fiction writers. But don't worry, once we add some effects like sounds and possibly a picture or two it'll look a whole heck of a lot better.
